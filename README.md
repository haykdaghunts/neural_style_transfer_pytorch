# Neural Style Transfer in Colab

Neural style transfer is an technique that blends the content of one image with the artistic style of another. This method uses deep convolutional neural networks to extract high-level representations of content and style, then uses an optimization process to generate a new image that mixes the two.

## Image Example

Here is an image included in the document:

![output](https://github.com/haykdaghunts/neural_style_transfer_pytorch/blob/main/output_image.jpg)




Check the `neural_style_transfer.ipynb` colab file to see implementation of the algorithm with pytorch.
